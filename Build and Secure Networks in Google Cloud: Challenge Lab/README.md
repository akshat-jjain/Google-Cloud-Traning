# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab


In this article, we will go through the lab Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud. In the previous, lab you will get familiar with User Authentication: Identity-Aware Proxy, Multiple VPC Networks,
VPC Networks Controlling Access, HTTP Load Balancer with Cloud Armor and Create an Internal Load Balancer.
#### The challenge contains 6 required tasks
- Remove the overly permissive rules.
- Start the bastion host instance.
- Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion.
- Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop.
- Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from the acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop.
- SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion.


#### Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:
- Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.
- Naming is normally a team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named kraken-webserver1
- Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing projectâ€™s termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed use f1-micro for small Linux VMs and n1-standard-1 for Windows or other applications such as Kubernetes nodes.

## 1. Create the production environment
The first step is to create open-access firewall rules.

> Use this command or Do Manually
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access
```

- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click on the box next to the rule named open-access.
- Then Click on Delete to remove.


## 2. Start the bastion host instance
In this step, you have a virtual machine and want to start.

> Use this command or Do Manually
```
gcloud compute instances start bastion
```

- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
- Click on the box next to the instance named bastion.
- Click on Start to run the instance.


## 3. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service.

> Use this command or Do Manually
> Replace `SSH IAP network tag` with your SSH IAP network tag.
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create SSH IAP network tag --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags SSH IAP network tag --network acme-vpc
gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=SSH IAP network tag --zone=us-central1-b
```

- Add network tag on bastion VM.
- Go to the VM Instance page, click on the bastion instance and click the Edit option
- Now Add `SSH IAP network tag` to the Network tags field.
- At the end of the page click Save.
- Now you have to create a firewall for bastion
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:

| Field                	| Value                                	|
|----------------------	|--------------------------------------	|
| Name                 	| e.g. `SSH IAP network tag`            |
| Direction of traffic 	| Ingress                              	|
| Targets              	| Specified target tags                	|
| Target tags          	| `SSH IAP network tag`                	|
| Source IP ranges     	| 35.235.240.0/20                      	|
| Protocols and ports  	| Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH 	|


## 4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address.
> Use this command or Do Manually
> Replace `HTTP network tag` with your HTTP network tag
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create HTTP network tag --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags HTTP network tag --network acme-vpc
gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=HTTP network tag --zone=us-central1-b
```
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:

| Field                	| Value                                 	|
|----------------------	|---------------------------------------	|
| Name                 	| e.g. `HTTP network tag`               	|
| Direction of traffic 	| Ingress                               	|
| Targets              	| Specified target tags                 	|
| Target tags          	| `HTTP network tag`                      |
| Source IP ranges     	| 0.0.0.0/0                             	|
| Protocols and ports  	| Select TCP and enter 80 to allow HTTP 	|

- Add network tag on juice-shop VM.
- Go to the VM Instance page, click on the juice-shop instance and click the Edit option
- Now Add `HTTP network tag` to the Network tags field.
- At the end of the page click Save.


## 5. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address.
> Use this command or Do Manually
> Replace `SSH internal network tag` with your SSH internal network tag
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create SSH internal network tag --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags SSH internal network tag --network acme-vpc
gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=SSH internal network tags --zone=us-central1-b
```
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network.
- Copy the IP address of the aceme-mgmt-subnet.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall> Firewall Rules.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:

| Field                	| Value                                      	|
|----------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|
| Name                 	| e.g. `SSH internal network tag`          	  |
| Direction of traffic 	| Ingress                                    	|
| Targets              	| Specified target tags                      	|
| Target tags          	| `SSH internal network tag`                 	|
| Source IP ranges     	| IP address range of your aceme-mgmt-subnet 	|
| Protocols and ports  	| Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH       	|


## 6. SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion
After configuring the firewall rules, try to verify the environment via the bastion.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
- Copy the Internal IP of the `juice-shop` instance.
- Then click on the SSH button in the row of the `bastion` instance.
- From the SSH console, access the juice-shop from the bastion using the following command:
```
ssh <internal-IP-of-juice-shop>
```
> Note:Replace `<internal-IP-of-juice-shop>` with Internal IP
