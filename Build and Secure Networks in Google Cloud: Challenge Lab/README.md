# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab


In this article, we will go through the lab Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud. In the previous, lab you will get familiar with User Authentication: Identity-Aware Proxy, Multiple VPC Networks,
VPC Networks Controlling Access, HTTP Load Balancer with Cloud Armor and Create an Internal Load Balancer.
#### The challenge contains 6 required tasks
- Remove the overly permissive rules.
- Start the bastion host instance.
- Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion.
- Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop.
- Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from the acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop.
- SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion.
#### Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:
- Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.
- Naming is normally a team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named kraken-webserver1
- Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing projectâ€™s termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed use f1-micro for small Linux VMs and n1-standard-1 for Windows or other applications such as Kubernetes nodes.

## 1. Create the production environment
The first step is to create open-access firewall rules.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click on the box next to the rule named open-access.
- Then Click on Delete to remove.
## 2. Start the bastion host instance
In this step, you have a virtual machine and want to start.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
- Click on the box next to the instance named bastion.
- Click on Start to run the instance.
## 3. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service.
- Add network tag on bastion VM.
- Go to the VM Instance page, click on the bastion instance and click the Edit option
- Now Add bastion to the Network tags field.
- At the end of the page click Save.
- Now you have to create a firewall for bastion
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:
Field- Value
Name- e.g. allow-ssh-from-iap
Direction of traffic- Ingress
Targets- Specified target tags
Target tags-bastion
Source IP ranges- 35.235.240.0/20
Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH

## 4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:
Field- Value
Name- e.g. allow-http-ingress
Direction of traffic- Ingress
Targets- Specified target tags
Target tags-juice-shop
Source IP ranges-0.0.0.0/0
Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 80 to allow HTTP

- Add network tag on juice-shop VM.
- Go to the VM Instance page, click on the juice-shop instance and click the Edit option
- Now Add juice-shop to the Network tags field.
- At the end of the page click Save.
## 5. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network.
- Copy the IP address of the aceme-mgmt-subnet.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall> Firewall Rules.
- Click Create firewall rule.
- Configure the following settings:
Field- Value
Name- e.g.allow-ssh-from-mgmt-subnet
Direction of traffic- Ingress
Targets- Specified target tags
Target tags-bastion,juice-shop
Source IP ranges- IP address range of your aceme-mgmt-subnet
Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH.

## 6. SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion
After configuring the firewall rules, try to verify the environment via the bastion.
- In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
- Copy the Internal IP of the juice-shop instance.
- Then click on the SSH button in the row of the bastion instance.
- From the SSH console, access the juice-shop from the bastion using the following command:
```
ssh <internal-IP-of-juice-shop>
```
> Note:Replace `<internal-IP-of-juice-shop>` with Internal IP
